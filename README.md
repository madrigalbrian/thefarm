# thefarm

I attended the Resilient Coders Bootcamp and I was tasked to build multiple tasks using JavaScript. 

Task:
- Build a farm web page using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript
- The animal images have to move and also trigger an audio sound when clicked on. 

Learnings: 
- Used event listeners 
- functions that applied more pixels to the images margin to move them around
